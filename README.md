# React Project - Quizzical

A quiz app made with React

**Why I made this?**
- This is a final personal project from a React course in Scrimba, and I made this to test my fundamentals of react
- By moving beyond from making static webpages to making interactive simple web app with frontend framework is a big leap for me in my coding journey

**Images**
- This is the application itself
